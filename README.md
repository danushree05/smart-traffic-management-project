## Introduction

This Adaptive Traffic Signal Timer uses live images from traffic junction cameras for traffic density calculation using YOLO object detection. It dynamically adjusts signal timers, reducing congestion, enhancing transit speed, and curbing fuel consumption.

## Features

- **Real-Time Traffic Analysis**: Utilizes YOLO object detection for live traffic density calculation.
- **Adaptive Signal Timing**: Adjusts signal timers based on current traffic, optimizing flow.
- **Congestion Reduction**: Prioritizes bus lanes, reducing individual vehicle count and congestion.
- **Environmental Impact**: Decreases fuel consumption and air pollution by streamlining traffic flow.

## Implementation

The project comprises three modules:
1. **Vehicle Detection**: Utilizes YOLO to detect vehicle count and types.
2. **Signal Switching Algorithm**: Dynamically adjusts signal timers based on detected traffic.
3. **Simulation Module**: Developed using Pygame to simulate traffic signals and vehicle movement.
